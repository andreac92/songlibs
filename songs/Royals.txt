I've never seen a NOUN1 in the flesh
I VERB1 my teeth on wedding PLURALN1 in the movies
And I'm not proud of my NOUN2,
In a torn-up PLACE1, no postcode EMOTION1

But every song's like gold NOUN3, COLOR1 goose, trippin' in the ROOM1
Blood PLURALN2, ball CLOTHING1, INGV1 the hotel room,
We don't care, we're driving CAR1 in our dreams.
But everybody's like DRINK1, Maybach, PLURALN3 on your timepiece.
Jet planes, PLURALN4, ANIMAL1 on a gold leash.
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your EMOTION2 affair.

And we'll never be PLURALN4 (PLURALN4).
It don't VERB2 in our blood,
That kind of NOUN4 just ain't for us.
We crave a different kind of NOUN5.
Let me be your OCCUPATION1 (OCCUPATION1),
You can call me queen NICKNAME1
And baby I'll VERB3, I'll VERB3, I'll VERB3, I'll VERB3.
Let me live that fantasy.

My friends and I, we've VERB4 the code.
We VERB5 our dollars on the TRANSPORT1 to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're ADJ1 with this,
We didn't come from NOUN6.

Ooh ooh oh
We're COMPA1 than we ever dreamed,
And I'm in love with being queen.
Ooh ooh oh
Life is ADJ2 without a care
We aren't caught up in your EMOTION2 affair.
