I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, ADJ1-looking
Going ADJ2, so ADJ2, just like a NOUN1
And I'll VERB1 myself, but just had to touch it
But it's so ADJ3 and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the INGV1, ha
Cause if they VERB2 close, real close
They might VERB3 something
She ain't nothing but a ADJ4 NOUN2 when she does it
She's so ADJ3 tonight

And as long as I got my CLOTHING1 and CLOTHING2
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got VERB4 up to the nines
Let me VERB5 you a few things
All pressed up in COLOR1 and COLOR2
And you're dressed in that CLOTHING3 I like
EMOTION1 is VERB6 in the air tonight
Let me VERB5 you a few things
Let me VERB5 you a few things
VERB5 you a few things about EMOTION1
Now we're in the swing of EMOTION1
Let me VERB5 you a few things
VERB5 you a few things about EMOTION1
Hey

Stop, let me get a good VERB7 at it
Oh, so ADJ5, now I know why they call it a fatty
And aww, shit's so ADJ6, got a hit and picked up a habit
But that's alright, cause you're all mine
Awww, go on and show 'em who you call "NICKNAME1"
I guess they're just EMOTION2 cause girl, they wish they had it
Oh, my NOUN3, my NOUN4, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight
