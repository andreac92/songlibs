My NOUN1 brings all the PPL1 to the PLACE1,
And they're like
It's COMPA1 than yours,
Damn right it's COMPA1 than yours,
I can VERB1 you, 
But I have to VERB2

I know you VERB3 it, 
The thing that makes me, 
What the PPL2 go ADJ1 for.
They lose their PLURALN1, 
The way I VERB4,
I think its time

La la-la la la,
VERB5 it up.
Lala-lalala,
The PPL1 are VERB6

I can see youre on it,
You want me to VERB7 thee
PLURALN2 that freaks these PPL1,
It can't be bought,
Just know, PPL3 get caught,
Watch if you're ADJ2

Oh, once you get VERB8,
Everyone will look this way-so,
You must maintain your NOUN2,
Same time maintain your NOUN3,
Just get the perfect NOUN4,
Plus what you have within,
Then next his BODYP1 are ADJ3,
Then he's picked up your NOUN5
