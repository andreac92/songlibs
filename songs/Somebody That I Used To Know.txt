***
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so ADJ1 you could die
Told myself that you were ADJ2 for me
But felt so ADJ3 in your company
But that was EMOTION1 and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of NOUN1
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make NOUN2
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was EMOTION2 it was over

But you didn't have to VERB1 me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were NOUN3
And I don't even need your NOUN4
But you treat me like a NOUN5 and that feels so ADJ5
No you didn't have to VERB2 so low
Have your friends collect your PLURALN1 and then change your NOUN6
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to VERB3

Now you're just somebody that I used to VERB3
Now you're just somebody that I used to VERB3

Now and then I think of all the times you VERB4 me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna VERB5 that way
Reading into every NOUN7 you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you VERB6 up on somebody that you used to VERB3
