I threw a NOUN1 in the well,
Don't VERB1 me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my NOUN2 for a NOUN1,
Pennies and dimes for a NOUN3
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way

Your stare was INGVERB1,
Ripped CLOTHING1, skin was INGVERB2
ADJ1 night, wind was INGVERB3
Where you think you're going, PETNAME1?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is ADJ2,
But here's my NOUN4,
So VERB2 me, maybe?

It's hard to VERB3 right,
At you PETNAME1,
But here's my NOUN4,
So VERB2 me, maybe?

And all the other PLURALN1,
Try to VERB3 me,
But here's my NOUN4,
So VERB2 me, maybe?
