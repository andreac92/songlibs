SongLibs
=========

A fun and easy to play madlibs game where you fill in the words to your favorite songs!

To Get Started
---------------
Download the source files and the "songs" file.

Compile the source files (gameGUI is the main class) or run them in Eclipse. The "songs" folder must be located in the same directory as the running program. If you would rather just run the JAR file, download the zip file at the following:


To Play
---------
Choose a song from the drop-down menu or click the "Random" button to have a song randomly chosen for you. You will be brought to a screen where you fill in several words based on type. For example, if a textfield is labeled as "NOUN," fill it in with a noun, or if it is labeled as "ING-VERB", fill it in with a verb ending in "ing."  

Click "Submit" when you are all finished to see the end result! If you want to do the same song again, hit the "Redo" button, or if you want to do another song, hit "Choose another song."
