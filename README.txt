SONGLIBS
--A fun and easy to play madlibs game where you fill in the words to your favorite songs!

TO GET STARTED:
Double-click the "SongLibs.jar" application file to start the game. 
**Note: Make sure this file stays within the Songlibs folder! You can move the folder anywhere within in your computer, just make sure you leave its contents where they are.

TO PLAY:
Choose a song from the drop-down menu or click the "Random" button to have a song randomly chosen for you. You will be brought to a screen where you fill in several words based on type. For example, if a textfield is labeled as "NOUN," fill it in with a noun, or if it is labeled as "ING-VERB", fill it in with a verb ending in "ing."  

Click "Submit" when you are all finished to see the end result! If you want to do the same song again, hit the "Redo" button, or if you want to do another song, hit "Choose another song." 

TO ADD ADDITIONAL SONGS:
If you get bored with the current song options, you can always add your own to the list! All that is required is a text editor where you can save .txt files (such as Notepad, TextEdit, Emacs, etc).

The format your file must follow is the following (detailed instructions below):

NOUN1 NOUN
INGV1 ING-VERB
NOUN2 NOUN
NOUN3 NOUN
NOUN4 NOUN
***
Yankee Doodle came to NOUN1
INGV1 in a ANIMAL1
stuck a NOUN2 in his NOUN3
and called it NOUN4


First, find the lyrics to a song of your choice and paste them into your text editor. Save it as a .txt file with the name as the title of the song as you want it to appear. For example, if your song was "Yankee Doodle" you would name your file: Yankee Doodle.txt

Then, choose which words in the lyrics you want to have users replace, by replacing them with a keyword in the text editor. It is recommended you make your keywords descriptive, such as by replacing the word "town" with NOUN1, but they don't have to be. The main requirement is that all keywords are unique--therefore it is wise to include numbers in them. Also, make sure one keyword is not contained in another. So, including both VERB2 AND INGVERB2 would not work, but VERB2 AND INGV2 would work.

Finally, make a list of all the keywords you created and put it at the beginning of the file. After each keyword, make a space and include a description of that keyword as you would like it to appear in the game. For example, for INGV1 which you want to describe as ING-VERB, simply put INGV1 ING-VERB.

At the end of your list, include three asterix (***) on its own line. The line after the asterix should be the start of your lyrics.

Save this file and put it in the "songs" subfolder of the SongLibs folder. Here you will find the other songs included in the list if you would like to see more examples.
